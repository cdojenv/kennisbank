The SEMIC Support Centre is the first step on a journey to become an interoperable European administration. In line with the Interoperable Europe Act, the SEMIC community stands for co-creation and sharing best practices. The Support Center is also home to a community of adopters that share tooling, standards and good practices to promote semantic interoperability.
